This Python script automates the process of scraping project data from multiple municipal websites, extracting and structuring the data using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, and standardizing the data for analysis or reporting. Here is a quick summary:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - The script imports necessary libraries, including Selenium for web scraping, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, pandas for data manipulation, and OpenAI's API for data extraction.
   - Logging is configured to provide informative messages about the script's execution.
   - The OpenAI API key is set from an environment variable.

2. **Data Extraction and Structuring**:
   - A function `extract_and_structure_data` uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to extract and structure relevant information from text descriptions.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - The `append_data` function appends extracted and structured data to a dictionary.
   - detect_changes(): Checks if the content of a URL has changed since the last check.
   - get_previous_hash() and save_current_hash(): Manage hash storage to detect changes.

4. **Web Scraping**:
   - The `scrape_website` function initializes a Selenium WebDriver, navigates to a given URL, and delegates the scraping task to specific functions (`scrape_richmond`, `scrape_eurekaca`, or `scrape_generic`) based on the URL.
   - `scrape_richmond` and `scrape_eurekaca` are tailored for Richmond and EurekaCA websites, respectively, handling their unique structures.
   - `scrape_generic` provides a fallback method for other sites, extracting data from HTML tables.

5. **Data Standardization**:
   - The `standardize_data` function formats the scraped data into a predefined structure, making it uniform across different sources.

6. **Scheduling the Script with Cron**
Open the crontab file:
sh
crontab -e

Add a cron job to run the script daily:
sh

0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script.py
This setup will check for website changes daily at midnight, scrape new data if changes are detected, and update the CSV file accordingly.

7. **Main Execution**:
   - The script iterates over a list of URLs, scrapes data from each, standardizes it, and concatenates all data into a single pandas DataFrame.
   - Finally, the consolidated data is saved to a CSV file.

This script efficiently collects, processes, and standardizes project data from various sources, leveraging both web scraping and AI for robust data extraction and structuring.
